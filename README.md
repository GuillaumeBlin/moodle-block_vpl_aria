Moodle 2.0+ block allowing aria support for vpl feedback
================

Synthesis
------------

This project allows to add a block to any wanted quiz in order to allow group grading regarding this quiz. 
It only work if the current user is part of a unique group. If it is so, when an attempt of the quiz is done, all the information of this attempt are also stored for the other members of the group. Somehow, it simulates the fact that the quiz was answered by a group of users.
It is inspired on the moodle-quiz_simulate moodle activity plugin of (@jamiepratt) and is using modified functions of this original great contribution in order to duplicate the attempt rather generating some new attempts.
  
Installation
------------

To install the plugin using git, execute the following commands in the root of your Moodle install:

    git clone https://github.com/GuillaumeBlin/moodle-block_quiz_gg.git your_moodle_root/blocks/quizz_gg
    
Or, extract the following zip in `your_moodle_root/blocks/` as follows:

    cd your_moodle_root/blocks/
    wget https://github.com/GuillaumeBlin/moodle-block_quiz_gg/archive/master.zip
    unzip -j master.zip -d quizz_gg
